% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex


%URL package for url links in the bibliography
\usepackage{url}


% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{bm}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\section{Introduction}
Thoracic surgery is a major invasive surgery involving operating on the lungs of a patient. The authors of ref. \cite{zikeba2014boosted} collected several pieces of possibly relevant data on a number patients who went on to have thoracic surgery. The data also includes a record of whether a given patient survived for longer than one year after the surgery. This paper looks at using a reduced subset of the features and patients from the dataset in \cite{zikeba2014boosted} to classify patients based on whether or not they will survive for one year after the surgery. This paper compares three different classifiers: random forests \cite{breiman2001random}, extremely randomised trees \cite{geurts2006extremely}, and gradient boosting \cite{natekin2013gradient}. 

The format of the result of this paper is structured as follows: section \ref{sec:methods} outlines the preprocessing steps performed on the dataset and describes the classifiers used. Section \ref{sec:results} presents the performance of the classifiers on the dataset. Section \ref{sec:discussion} discusses the results and presents possible justification for the performance based on the properties of the classifier and dataset. Finally, a summary and discussion of possible future directions are discussed in section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}
\label{subsec:dataset}
The thoracic surgery dataset used consists of 16 predictors and 300 instances. Table \ref{table:dataset-columns} gives a description of each predictor derived from the original UCI dataset repository \cite{uic2016thoracic}. The dataset includes a mixture of both categorical (nominal and ordinal) and continuous data. The final (17$^{th}$) column of the dataset is the binary class label with value 0 if the patient survived and 1 if they died within one year of surgery.

Several initial observations can be made about dataset prior to any preprocessing steps. One key thing to note about the dataset as a whole is that there is a slight imbalance between the two classes. Only 28\% of the dataset is of the positive class (28\% of patients died). While this imbalance is not extreme, it can have repercussions for the performance of the classifiers. The accuracy paradox \cite{bishop2006pattern} states that a classifier with high accuracy can be built from highly imbalanced training by always predicting the negative class.

The predictor PRE32 is zero for all of the patients in the training dataset. This predictor therefore has zero variation and will not help to discriminate between instance. PRE32 is therefore discarded during preprocessing. 

PRE5 appears to have some extreme values. PRE5 corresponds to the FEV1 measure. This would suggest that some patients have an unusually high forced expiration volume. Also, all of the outliers are of the same class. This could cause the classifiers to fit to noise rather than to properly generalise. These instances were therefore removed from the dataset. No reduction in performance was witnessed during cross validation for all classifiers after their removal.

The feature DGN is a nominal categorical predicator. This feature was transformed into series of new features via one hot encoding. Each new predictor is a binary feature which is one if the patient falls into the category and zero otherwise. The original DGN feature is drop after the 7 new binary features are created.

\subsection{Classifiers}
\label{subsec:classifiers}
Four classifiers were chosen for use on the dataset. The four classifiers used are Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Extra Trees. The implementations of all four classifiers are taken directly from the scikit-learn library \cite{pedregosa2011scikit}. All of these methods are known as ensemble methods. Ensemble methods compose together multiple weak learners a single strong classifier.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Performance Evaluation}
\label{subsec:performance}

Each classifier in section \ref{subsec:classifiers} was trained using stratified 5-fold cross validation. Stratification was performed to ensure that there was a representative sample of positive classes in each fold. For all classifiers cross validation was repeated ten times, each with a new set of folds to ensure consistent results.

Figure \ref{fig:roc-cv} shows the mean ROC curve and mean AUC for each of the classifier after cross validation. The performance of each classifier appears to be very similar. Notably the ROC curve for each type of classifier is shifted to the right of the graph, suggesting that they all exhibit a low recall rate.

Table \ref{table:f-scores} and figure \ref{fig:f2-score} confirm this indication. Table \ref{table:f-scores} shows the F measure with a $\beta$ parameter of 1, 2, and 0.5. Figure \ref{fig:f2-score} shows a bar chart of the F2 scores in table \ref{table:f-scores}. The performance of all classifiers measured with the F2 score (which weights recall more highly than precision) is much lower in comparison to the F0.5 and F1 scores. This further confirms that all classifiers have a problem with recall.

\label{fig:f2-score}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Engineered Features}
In addition to the preprocessing steps outlined in \ref{subsec:dataset} several combinations of new features were generated from the existing predictors. Firstly, as a large portion of the features are binary, a set of new features were created based on logical binary operators. The creation of the binary features is as follows: all pairs of binary features are enumerated. From each pair three new features are created by combining the pair using logical OR, AND and XOR.

The second modification to the original dataset is to create a couple of new features called FER and OBS. FER is the FEV1/FVC ratio which is spirometry measurement defined as $(FEV1/FVC) \cdot 100$ \cite{patient2016spirometry}. It is interpreted as the percentage of FVC expelled in the first second of a forced expiration. A ratio value below <70\% can be suggestive of an obstructive disease. Using this information another feature (OBS) is generated from the ratio. OBS is a binary feature with value 1 when a patient has a ratio <70\%.

Finally, a selection of new features are created from all order 2 polynomial combinations of the two best (numerical) predictors: PRE4 and PRE5. This means that the new features are of the form $a^2$, $ab$, $b^2$ where $a$ and $b$ are PRE4 and PRE5 respectively. This polynomial combination led to the best predictive results across all classifiers under cross validation.


\subsection{Dataset Balancing}
\label{subsec:dataset-balancing}
As mentioned in section \ref{subsec:dataset} the thoracic surgery dataset is class imbalanced with only 28\% of the dataset being of the positive class. One technique to combat class imbalance is to resample the dataset to put more emphasis on the known positive examples. A popular technique for resampling data is SMOTE \cite{chawla2002smote}. SMOTE rebalances a dataset by creating new synthetic training to balance out the majority class. SMOTE is typically combined with under-sampling of the majority class to produce a final dataset that is re-weighted in favour of the minority class. 

The results for the classifiers in part \ref{subsec:performance} shows that they have lower recall than precision. Rebalancing the dataset should show a decrease in precision and an increase in recall rate. This can be desirable in a dataset such as this where recall may be more important than precision. It is probably more desirable overestimate the number people who are likely to die from surgery than to achieve better precision.

SMOTE datasets cannot be validated using conventional k-fold cross validation. This is because the testing fold would contain synthetically generated training examples which are obviously not representative of the ground truth. Instead, in order to achieve a representative sample of performance, ``Monte Carlo'' cross-validation \cite{dubitzky2007fundamentals} is used. Before a any resampling is applied, the data set is randomly split into a training and testing set. The split is stratified according to the class labels. All reported experiments use and 80/20 split. Resampling is then applied to the training dataset only, with the testing set remaining untouched. This process is then repeated for the desired number of iterations and the resulting performance measures are averaged. In all experiments the number of iterations performed was 50.  

Figure \ref{fig:roc-smote} shows ROC curve and mean AUC scores for each of the classifiers using SMOTE with a resampling ratio of 0.8. Table \ref{table:f-score-smote} shows the F1, F2, and F0.5 scores for each of the classifiers. Comparing this table to the results of \ref{table:f-scores} shows a clear difference in the F2 score. Recall weighted performance is now better both than F1 and F0.5. This improvement comes at the cost of a decrease in both the AUC and F0.5 measures. Increasing the oversampling ratio or under-sampling the majority class accentuates this effect.

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../src/img/roc_smote.png}
\caption{ROC curves for all four classifiers with SMOTE oversampling with a ratio of 0.8. Each curve represents the average over 50 iterations of Monte Carlo validation. The ROC curves for all classifiers are less skewed compared to figure \ref{fig:roc-cv}.}
